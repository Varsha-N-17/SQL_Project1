## 🧠 Key SQL Techniques Used

This project demonstrates a variety of advanced SQL techniques to extract meaningful insights from the music store database:

##### 1. Data Aggregation
Utilized aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, and `AVG()` to summarize data and identify trends across multiple records.
##### 2. Joins
Applied different types of joins such as `INNER JOIN` to combine data from multiple related tables based on common keys.
##### 3. Subqueries
Used subqueries to perform nested queries, enabling more complex filtering and computations within a single SQL statement.
##### 4. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
Implemented CTEs using `WITH` clauses to create temporary result sets, improving query readability and modularity.
##### 5. Window Functions
Employed window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()` with `OVER(PARTITION BY...)` to perform calculations across specific partitions of data.
